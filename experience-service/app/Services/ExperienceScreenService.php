/**
 * ExperienceScreenService — Data aggregation layer for Screen 302 (Experience detail).
 *
 * Architecture role:
 *   This service is the backend for Screen 302's three tabs:
 *     1. Students tab: getEnrolledStudents(), exportStudentList(), getStudentDetail()
 *     2. Contents tab: getContentsAndDelivery()
 *     3. Statistics tab: getExperienceStatistics()
 *
 *   It is an "aggregation service" — it does not own any data itself. Instead, it
 *   combines data from two sources:
 *     - Enrolment Service (port 8003): cohorts, enrolments, student counts (via HTTP)
 *     - CourseDataProviderInterface: course names, block structures (via Strategy pattern)
 *
 * Cross-service HTTP calls:
 *   This service makes the most inter-service calls in the Experience Service codebase.
 *   Every method that calls the Enrolment Service follows the same pattern:
 *     1. Forward the user's bearer token (so the Enrolment Service can authenticate)
 *     2. Set a 5-second timeout (prevent hanging if the Enrolment Service is slow)
 *     3. Wrap in try/catch and return empty/zero data on failure (graceful degradation)
 *
 *   Enrolment Service endpoints used:
 *     - GET /api/school/enrolments?experience_id={id}          -> student list
 *     - GET /api/school/enrolments?student_id={id}&experience_id={id} -> student detail
 *     - GET /api/school/cohorts?experience_id={id}             -> statistics
 *
 * @see \App\Http\Controllers\ExperienceScreenController  The controller that calls this service
 * @see \App\Contracts\CourseDataProviderInterface          Strategy interface for course data
