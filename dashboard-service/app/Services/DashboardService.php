/**
 * DashboardService — Core aggregation logic for Screen 300 (School Admin Dashboard).
 *
 * Architecture role:
 *   This is the heart of the Dashboard Service. It owns NO database tables.
 *   Instead, it acts as an aggregation layer that:
 *   1. Calls the Experience Service (port 8002) for experience/course data
 *   2. Calls the Enrolment Service (port 8003) for cohort and enrolment data
 *   3. Delegates to injected Strategy providers for credential and progress data
 *   4. Merges everything into unified JSON responses for the frontend
 *
 * Design patterns used:
 *   - Repository: This service is the repository boundary between the controller
 *     and all data sources (HTTP services + provider interfaces)
 *   - Strategy: The credentialProvider and progressProvider are injected via
 *     interfaces, allowing mock/real implementations to be swapped in AppServiceProvider
 *   - Factory Method: Widget-related methods delegate to DashboardWidgetFactory
 *
 * Graceful degradation:
 *   Every HTTP call to a downstream service is wrapped in try/catch with a 5-second
 *   timeout. If a service is down, the response still succeeds (HTTP 200) with
 *   zero/empty fallback values and a 'service_degraded' warning in the warnings array.
 *   This ensures the frontend can render a partial dashboard rather than showing
 *   a full error page.
 *
 * Cross-service HTTP calls:
 *   All HTTP calls forward the caller's bearer token so that downstream services
 *   can authenticate and enforce school scoping. The service URLs are configured
 *   in config/services.php (services.experience.url, services.enrolment.url).
 *
 * @see \App\Http\Controllers\DashboardController  The thin controller that delegates here
 * @see \App\Factories\DashboardWidgetFactory       Factory for widget instantiation
