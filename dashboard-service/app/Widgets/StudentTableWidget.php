/**
 * StudentTableWidget — Student roster with enrolment status for the dashboard.
 *
 * Design pattern: Factory Method (concrete product)
 *   This is a concrete DashboardWidget created by DashboardWidgetFactory when
 *   the type is 'student_table'. It powers the student list section on Screen 300
 *   where admins can see all students in their school with their enrolment status.
 *
 * Data sources:
 *   - Local DB: Queries the users table for students in the school (school_id scoped)
 *   - Enrolment Service (port 8003): Fetches enrolment/cohort assignment data
 *
 * Cross-service HTTP calls:
 *   Makes ONE HTTP call to GET {enrolment_service}/api/school/enrolments
 *   Expected response: { "data": [ { "student_id": 3, "cohort_assignments": [...], ... }, ... ] }
 *   On failure: students are still shown but with 'unknown' enrolment status.
 *
 * Status derivation logic:
 *   - 'enrolled'   — Student is in at least one active cohort
 *   - 'inactive'   — Student is in cohorts, but none are active (all completed/not_started)
 *   - 'unassigned' — Student has no cohort assignments at all
 *   - 'unknown'    — Enrolment Service was unavailable; we can't determine status
 *
 * @see \App\Contracts\DashboardWidget          Interface this implements
 * @see \App\Factories\DashboardWidgetFactory   Factory that instantiates this
